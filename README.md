# LeNet-5_Speed_Up

LeNet-5 digit recognition CNN has been optimized using OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI for improved performance.

## Project Description

This project focuses on optimizing the performance of the LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition using parallel computing frameworks. LeNet-5, a foundational CNN architecture, is adapted for efficiency improvements by employing OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI:

- **OpenMP**: Utilized for multi-threaded parallelism on CPUs to enhance training and testing speeds.
- **CUDA**: Harnesses GPU parallel computing to accelerate matrix computations and training processes.
- **MPI**: Employs distributed memory systems for efficient workload distribution and inter-node communication.

The optimizations include advanced techniques like parallelizing convolutional operations, pooling, backpropagation, and softmax calculations. Execution times and speed-up metrics highlight significant performance improvements in both training and testing phases.

### Key Features
- Digit recognition with enhanced accuracy and reduced execution time.
- Parallelized implementations for large-scale datasets.
- Comparative analysis of OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI for CNN optimization.
